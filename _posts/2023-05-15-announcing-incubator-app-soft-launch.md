Hi all!

I'd like to announce the soft launch of the [JMES Incubator App](https://jmesincubator.app/).

Dash Incubator lets anyone earn Dash by completing Bounties created in the App.

Get rewarded for JMES stuff

Everything is incentivized and everything is public, there’s no company or private organization behind it and all decision making and operations are transparent.  You can read more about the App in our [Rules]({{site.baseurl}}/rules).

This is our first version and there’s tons to do, but we’re working hard to improve things, please stay tuned!

Enjoy & Thanks!
